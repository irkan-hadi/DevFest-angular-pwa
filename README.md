# What is this?
This is the second part of the PWA workshop for GDG DevFest Muscat 2017.

# What is used?
Angular 5.1 with cli 1.6, open weather widget and chart.js angular components are integrated and they fetch forecast data from open weather api.

We also make our own native call to the web serivce to cache the results using the service worker so if the network is down, the forecast will be down but not the current weather

# Important
Make sure you get your own open weather api key (its free from their website, 60 visits per hours AFAK) and replace it inside the source
